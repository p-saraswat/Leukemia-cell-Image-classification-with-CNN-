# Leukemia-classification using CNN 

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common type of childhood cancer and accounts for approximately 25% of the pediatric cancers.

These cells have been segmented from microscopic images and are representative of images in the real-world because they contain some staining noise and illumination errors, although these errors have largely been fixed in the course of acquisition.

The task of identifying immature leukemic blasts from normal cells under the microscope is challenging due to morphological similarity and thus the ground truth labels were annotated by an expert oncologist.

In total there are 15,135 images from 118 patients with two labelled classes:

***Normal cell***;
